QABuddy.ai — Build Prompt (Advanced Hybrid RAG for QA Engineers)

1. Context & Role
   You are acting as a senior AI engineer. Design and build QABuddy.ai — a self-hosted, multi-source Hybrid RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for the QA engineers at my company.

The end product: a QA engineer asks one question and gets a single cited answer, grounded in our Selenium framework, Playwright framework, VWO test case repository, PRDs, and JIRA bug history.

2. Objective
   Build an end-to-end system that:

Ingests code and documents from a defined folder structure (Phase 1)
Chunks, embeds, and indexes them in an open-source vector database with hybrid (keyword + semantic) retrieval
Serves grounded answers with citations through a chatbot
Runs 24x7 on a DigitalOcean droplet (or similar VPS / self-hosted server) for internal company use
Keeps token usage low by retrieving only the relevant context 3. Use Cases to Support
Onboarding: new team members can self-serve answers
QA knowledge base: a "KB brain" connected to our code repos — a one-stop resource system
Test failure analysis and root cause analysis (RCA)
Test design: test case creation, test plan drafting, test case review, and identifying missing test cases (gaps)
Process artifacts: RTM building, bug triage, and test analyst workflows
Flaky tests: feed in build/run data and retrieve flaky test history later
Framework coding help: best practices, scripts, coding exercises, and doubt-busting at our framework level
Target impact on test coverage:

Setup Expected test coverage
GitHub Copilot + JIRA ID (MCP) ~30–40%
GitHub Copilot + RAG (LLM) + JIRA ID ~70–80% 4. Data Sources (10)
Your first task: create one folder per source below. I will place the Phase 1 data into these folders so your pipeline can fetch it.

# Source Format / location Phase

1 Selenium framework repo https://github.com/PramodDutta/ATB13xSeleniumAdvanceFramework
2 Playwright framework repo https://github.com/PramodDutta/Advance-Playwright-Framework
3 Test cases (~5,000) CSV / XLSX (e.g., testdata.csv) 1
4 JIRA tickets Live via JIRA MCP connection + JQL (I will share both) 1
5 Company docs PDF, MD 1
6 Figma designs — ER diagrams, user guides, wireframes Figma exports 2
7 Meeting notes & recordings Text transcripts 1
8 Lucid charts Exported to text 1
9 PRD / SRS / BRD / FRD PDF 1
10 Jenkins logs & results Log / text files 1 5. Phase 1 — Build Now
Create the folder structure for all 10 sources
Build the ingestion pipeline: parse → clean → chunk → embed → index, with source-appropriate handling (code vs. spreadsheet rows vs. prose vs. logs)
Connect to JIRA via MCP and ingest all tickets returned by the JQL I provide
Implement hybrid retrieval with citations — every answer must reference its source file / ticket
Build the chatbot layer, deployable to my DigitalOcean / VPS machine 6. Phase 2 — Plan Only (do not build yet)
Hourly auto-ingestion: detect new test cases, new repo commits, or new documents, and re-index automatically every hour
Figma design ingestion (ER diagrams, user guides, wireframes) 7. Decisions I Need From You (with justification)
Which open-source embedding model should I use?
Which open-source vector database should I use?
What is the accurate chunk size and overlap — per source type (code, test case rows, PDFs, transcripts, logs)?
What preprocessing / text normalization should be applied (terminology handling, metadata, cleanup)?
What should the overall architecture, structure, and plan be? 8. Constraints
Embedding model and vector database must be open source
Self-hosted on a DigitalOcean droplet / VPS, used internally within my company
Available 24x7 and token-efficient 9. How to Respond
I will also share a rough architecture diagram. Before writing any code:

Present your full plan and architecture, and explain how you thought about it
Justify your choices for the embedding model, vector DB, chunk size, and overlap
Show the proposed folder structure for the 10 sources
Wait for my approval, then implement Phase 1 end-to-end.
